### Bangladesh Floods

Bangladesh is known as one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. Every year [the monsoon](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/monsoon/), a weather phenomenon caused by changes in wind direction and transportation of moist air, usually produces heavy rainfall from June through September. In early July 2019, heavy rains and consequently overflowing rivers flooded numerous districts in northern Bangladesh, forcing nearly 200,000 people to flee their homes ([related article](http://floodlist.com/asia/bangladesh-monsoon-floods-july-2019)). Additionally, on the night of 17 July 2019 the [Jamuna River broke through a flood bank](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/view/66848) and swamped at least 40 villages, aggravating the effects of the monsoon period in the region. A timely identification of flooded areas is essential for an effective flood response. The inundation maps, utilizing Short wave infrared composite (SWIR) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), show the difference between the usual landscape state and effects of the 2019 Bangladesh floods and facilitate natural disaster management assessment.
