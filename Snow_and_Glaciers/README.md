Its various shades of grey and blue, clearly visible even from space, attract many visitors each year. In 2017 a huge (380 m x 350 m) [iceberg ruptured](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/29/large-iceberg-breaks-off-from-grey-glacier-in-southern-chile) from the glacier with the cause unknown. Such events are very rare, with the last one occurring in the early 1990's. Due to its diverse plants and wildlife, glaciers, rivers, lakes and pampas, the park became [protected as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve](http://www.ecocamp.travel/fr/Patagonia/Torres-del-Paine-National-Park) in 1978.
