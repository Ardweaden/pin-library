### Cloud Optical Thickness

The [optical thickness of a cloud](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/optical-thickness.html) is the degree to which the cloud prevents light from passing through it. By measuring how much sunlight gets scattered by clouds back up into space, scientists can better understand how much [clouds influence Earth's climate](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MYDAL2_M_CLD_OT). Optical thickness depends on the clouds [physical constitution](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Optical_thickness) (crystals, drops, droplets), and form; the overall effect depends on the particles concentration, scatter parameter and phase function, as well as the vertical extent of the cloud.
