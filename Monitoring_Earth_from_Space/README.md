## Included pins 

### 1. Sundarbans, Mangrove Forest (NDVI)
 
[Mangrove forests](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/mangroves.html) have exceptionally high biodiversity and are indispensable in erosion reduction. There are 80 different species of mangrove trees known, growing in low-oxygen soil, where slow moving waters accumulate fine sediments for the roots to grow in. [Sundarbans Mangrove forest](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/798/) covers 140.000 ha of land, making it one of the largest Mangrove forests in the world. It provides livelihood to many people living in the area and is a home to, among others, 250 bird species and an endangered Royal Bengal Tiger. The forest is threatened by seasonal monsoons, cyclones and tidal waves, which cause salinization.
